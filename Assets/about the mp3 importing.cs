// alright so i dont want this drag and drop please make this a file explorer thingy

// when you select the mp3, if you can it should show some sort of player settings to play and pause the song or just stop it, if thats not possible thats fine, people can just restart the app to play another song

// the triangle speed should be multiplied by the loudness of the mp3 (loudest mp3 will ever get should be 1, so it goes from 0-1) all at once

// if posisble, it should support as many audio formats as you can

// alright thanks
